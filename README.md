# Chess

I developed a simple chess application, using Python Tkinter GUI. This application allows two people to play the game of chess, according to classic rules (including castling and capturing en-passant). Being a project for the Bachelorâ€™s Degree at FII, it will also include the following features: the user will be able to customize how each piece moves and there will be a built-in AI engine, which will play the user according to the custom set rules.
